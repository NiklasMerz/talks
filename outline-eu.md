# Why

I encountered quite a few projects where the maintainer group is very small but dedicated. Having only a few people responsible for the well-being of a project is not sustainable as only one or two people becoming inactive could mean the death of the project.

Users and maintainers should be aware of the state of the project and take steps to encourage people invested in the project to contribute to the best of their abilities.

# Looking at the village

* Every project is different
* Size, demographics, age & maturity of project, nothing stays the same forever

# Interesting Survey results

* Most used platforms match our expectation
* Deprecated stuff is barely used
* Personal feel of pressing issues confirmed
* Good ideas to work on
* Documenation!

# Finding people to pick up the work

* scratch your own itch
* hard to find someone for the other tasks


# Types of maintainers

### Silent hero

* Stays in background
* Does a lot / most of the work
* Ungrateful tasks:
  * Releases
  * Updates, refactorings

### Helping hand

* Contact person for the community
* Very important for the outward perception of the project and gaining new fans

### Advocate

* Voice of the projects
* Talks and promotions
* Website, Documentations etc.

### Legend

* Started the project or there since "the early days"
* Lot of deep knowledge
* Knows the history behind things
* Sometimes hard to reach because they may have moved on to other things

> Try to keep them around

# Is the project sustainable?

* People available for fixes and security issues
* Getting releases out (votes)
* Development getting stuck
* Maintainer burnout

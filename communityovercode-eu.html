# Agenda

0. Why this talk?
1. Facts about me
2. Looking at the village
3. Interesting Survey results
4. Finding people to pick up the work
5. Types of maintainers
6. Is the project sustainable?

???

* Roadmap for this talk

---

# Why

* Many projects have a very small but dedicated maintainer group
* Users and maintainers have different perceptions and goals for a project
* Asses the state of the project
* Inform user group of state of the project and find new maintainers
* Indetify areas for improvement

???

I encountered quite a few projects where the maintainer group is very small but dedicated. Having only a few people
responsible for the well-being of a project is not sustainable as only one or two people becoming inactive could mean
the death of the project.

Users and maintainers should be aware of the state of the project and take steps to encourage people invested in the
project to contribute to the best of their abilities.

* I got help from AI for drawing pictures because I can't draw

???

* Give some context
* I work with Apache Cordova which is a framework for **building mobile apps using web technologies**

# Looking at the village

* Every project is different
* Is the project sustainable?
* People available for fixes and security issues
* Getting releases out and votes done in time
* Development getting stuck
* Maintainer burnout
* Size, demographics, age & maturity of project, nothing stays the same forever

## Types of maintainers

???

* From my experience there are common types of maintainers
* Person can be more than one type
* Good to know what types of people are needed to run the project
* **Names are totally made up by me**

---

### Silent hero

* Stays in background
* Does a lot of coding work
* Thankless tasks:
  * Releases
  * Updates, refactorings
  * Documentation
  * ....
* Drives progress

???

From my experience this is the most important type of maintainer to keep a project alive

* Does not need attention
* Does a lot of coding work
* Thankless tasks:
  * Releases
  * Updates, refactorings
  * Documentation
* Wants to work effectively and drive progress

---

### Helping hand

* Contact person for the community
* Answers a lot of user questions
* Issue triage and response

???

* Very important for the outward perception of the project and gaining new users
* First contact person for new users and contributors
* Keeps track of issues and and user questions

---

### Advocate

* Voice of the projects
* Talks and promotions
* Website, Documentations etc.

???

**Some projects may have a marketing person**

* Voice of the project
* Talks and promotions
* Website, documentations etc.

---

### Founder/Legend

* Started the project or contributor since "the early days"
* Lots of deep knowledge
* Knows the history behind things
* Sometimes hard to reach because they may have moved on to other things

???

* Started the project or contributor since "the early days"

# Is the project sustainable?

* People available for fixes and security issues
* Decisions are made and not stalled
* Getting releases out (votes)
* Technical debt is addressed, refactorings are done successfully
* Development getting stuck
* Maintainer burnout

???

You ask questions like:
* Is it risky using this because it might go dead?
* Is it worth to invest in this project?

* With some experience you get a feeling.

* People available for fixes and security issues
* Decisions are made and not stalled
* Getting releases out (votes)
* Technical debt is addressed, refactorings are done successfully
* Development getting stuck

---

# Closing words

* Get to know the projects you love or need for your business
* **Maintainers** please encourage contributions
* **Open source beginners** please just start contributing

???

Every project is different

* Get to know the projects you love or need for your business
* Paid support options are in demand
* Maintainers please encourage contributions
* Open source beginners please just start contributing

**Getting new maintainers in costs time but is a worthwile investment**

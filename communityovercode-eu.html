# Agenda

0. Why this talk?
1. Facts about me
2. Looking at the village
3. Interesting Survey results
4. Finding people to pick up the work
5. Types of maintainers
6. Is the project sustainable?

???

* Roadmap for this talk

---

# Why

* Many projects have a very small but dedicated maintainer group
* Users and maintainers have different perceptions and goals for a project
* Asses the state of the project
* Inform user group of state of the project and find new maintainers
* Indetify areas for improvement

???

I encountered quite a few projects where the maintainer group is very small but dedicated. Having only a few people
responsible for the well-being of a project is not sustainable as only one or two people becoming inactive could mean
the death of the project.

Users and maintainers should be aware of the state of the project and take steps to encourage people invested in the
project to contribute to the best of their abilities.

# Facts about me

* Apache Cordova User
* Apache Cordova contributor in my old job
* Active Committer & PMC
* No longer real user of Cordova but maintainer in my free time
* I suck at writing CSS
* This presentation is styled using CSS

???

* Give some context
* I work with Apache Cordova which is a framework for **building mobile apps using web technologies**
* **Previous job** introduced to developing apps this way
* We got more and more advanced users and I started contributing
* I became a committer and PMC member
* I no longer build apps but I'm helping when I can
* Fun fact CSS

# Looking at the village

* Every project is different
* Is the project sustainable?
* People available for fixes and security issues
* Getting releases out and votes done in time
* Development getting stuck
* Maintainer burnout
* Size, demographics, age & maturity of project, nothing stays the same forever

---

# Running a survey

???

* At Cordova we ran a survey.
* Collected questions on GitHub
* Open Google Survey
* Announced & Promoted it on website and social media
* Open for month
* Closed and compiled results
* 200 responses
* Got a feel for the size of the community because only a fraction of users will respond
* Good usage data
* Open questions with great feedback
* Lot's of work for open questions

---

# Interesting Survey results

* Most used platforms match our expectation
* Personal impression got confirmed
* Deprecated stuff is barely used
* Personal feel of pressing issues confirmed
* Good ideas to work on
* Documentation!

---

# Pick up the work

* scratch your own itch
* hard to find someone for other more boring or difficult tasks

---

# Motivation

* Extrinsic
* Get stuff done for business
* Paid work gets done
* General maintenance and community building is usually unpaid

* Intrinsic
* Love for the project and/or community
* **What about tasks that don't fall in someones motivation window?**
* Looking for ideas

## Types of maintainers

???

* From my experience there are common types of maintainers
* Person can be more than one type
* Good to know what types of people are needed to run the project
* **Names are totally made up by me**

# Warning: AI Content Incoming

## DALL-E painted the following pictures

???

* This presentation is really lacking in images and I'm even worse at drawing than writing CSS
* I didn't use these fancy AI tools before so I thought it would be interesting to see what it comes up with just giving it my descriptions of the maintainer types
* My first observation is that it shows the stereotypes of maintainers we might have in our heads
* Dont't take these images too seriously and let's focus on the personas

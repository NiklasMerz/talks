???

* Hello I'm Niklas and welcome to my talk about maintainers and users of open source
* Open source communities to me are like villages
* Every village has different people and different needs or problems and also interesting relations to other villages
* Projects at the ASF can learn a lot from each other and get ideas from each other
* That's why I would like to share some insights from a survey we ran at Apache Cordova and my observations from our little village

---

# Agenda

0. Why this talk?
1. Facts about me
1. Looking at the village
1. Interesting Survey results
1. Finding people to pick up the work
1. Motivation
1. Types of maintainers
1. Is the project sustainable?

???

* First a roadmap for this talk
* Start with giving some context
* Then talk about pur survey and what we learned
* I'd like to discuss how we get work done in open source and what motivates people
* Then there is the fun part - I'd like to introduce some maintainer types
* And finally I'd like to bring sustainability into the discussion

---

# Why

* Many projects have a very small but dedicated maintainer group
* Users and maintainers have different perceptions and goals for a project
* Check the health of the project
* Inform user group about state of the project
* Indetify areas for improvement
* Attract new maintainers

???

* Many projects have a very small but dedicated maintainer group
* Users and maintainers have different perceptions and goals for a project
* Occasionally asses the state of the project and could do a **health check for themselves**
* From time to time I think projects should inform user group about state of the project
* Users & maintainers can work together to indetify areas for improvement
* By definining work that needs to be done projects can attract new maintainers

---

# Facts about me

* Apache Cordova User
* Apache Cordova contributor in my old job
* Active Committer & PMC
* No longer real user of Cordova but maintainer in my free time
* I suck at writing CSS
* This presentation is styled using CSS

<img src="img/cordova.png" alt="Cordova" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">

???

* **Some facts about me**
* I became a user of Apache Cordova many years ago
* Cordova is a framework for **building mobile apps using web technologies**
* **My previous job** introduced to developing apps using this approach
* In that job we got more and more advanced users and I started contributing
* A few years later I became a committer and PMC member
* I no longer build apps but I'm helping the project where I can
* Fun fact CSS

# Looking at the village

* Every project is different
* Is the project sustainable and healthy?
* People available for fixes and security issues
* Getting releases out and votes done in time
* Size, demographics, age & maturity of project, nothing stays the same forever

???

* ** First let's a have a look at a village**
* Projects and their communities are very diverse
* If you consider using a new project you might ask is the project sustainable and healthy?
* Are enough maintainers available for fixes and security issues?
* Are releases getting out in time and votes done?
* The size, demographics, age and maturity of a project can change over time

# Running a survey

* Collected questions on GitHub
* Google Survey
* Announced & promoted it on website and social media
* Open for a month
* Around 200 responses

???

* I was curious about our project and community
* At Cordova we ran a survey.
* Collected questions on in a simple document on  GitHub
* Google Survey
* Announced & promoted it on website and social media
* Accepted answers for a month
* Closed and compiled results
* got around 200 responses
* We consider this a good result because only a fraction of users will respond

---

# Interesting Survey results

* Good usage data on platforms
* Open questions with great feedback
* Lot's of work for open questions
* Most used platforms match our expectation
* Personal feel of pressing issues confirmed
* Documentation is the biggest issue

???

* Good usage data on platforms
* Open questions with great feedback
* Lot's of work for open questions
* Most used platforms match our expectation
* Deprecated stuff is barely used
* Personal feel of pressing issues confirmed
* Good ideas to work on
* Documentation is the biggest issue
---

# Pick up the work

* We got some ideas for large tasks from the survey
* Scratch your own itch
* How about the other more boring or difficult tasks?
* Documentation is critical

???

* **After the survey it's probably time to do some work**
* Created Large tasks from the survey
* Scratch your own itch is how open source usually works
* Hard to find someone for other more boring or difficult tasks
* How to get better documentation when developers don't like writing docs?
* **A lot boils down to motivation**

# Motivation

### “Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation” 

@BALUPTON. via isaacs/github (“Working in Public - The making and maintenance of open source software” by Nadia Eghbal.)

???

* I found this great quote in a book about open source

* **Intrinsic**
  * Fix things or build features for my project
  * This work is usualy getting done fast
  * Love for the project and community

* **Extrinsic**
  * If you pay someone to work on a project there is extrinsic motivation
  * General maintenance and community building is usually unpaid


* **What about tasks that don't fall in someones motivation window?**
* Looking for ideas

## Maintainer personas

???

* From my experience there are common types of maintainers
* Of course one person can be more than one type
* Good to know what types of people are needed to run the project
* **Names are totally made up by me**

# Warning: AI Content Incoming

## ChatGPT painted the following pictures

???

* Short AI warning 
* This presentation is really lacking in images because I'm even worse at drawing than writing CSS
* I tried giving the AI my persona descriptions and it came up with these images
* Dont't take these images too seriously

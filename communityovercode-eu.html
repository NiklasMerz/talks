???

* Hello I'm Niklas and welcome to my talk maintainers and users
* Open source communities to me are like villages
* Every village has different people and different needs or problems and also interesting relations to each other villages
* Projects at the ASF can learn a lot from each other and get ideas from each other
* That's why I would like to share some insights from a survey we ran at Apache Cordova and my observations from our little village

---

# Agenda

0. Why this talk?
1. Facts about me
1. Looking at the village
1. Interesting Survey results
1. Finding people to pick up the work
1. Motivation
1. Types of maintainers
1. Is the project sustainable?

???

* First a roadmap for this talk
* Start with giving some context
* Then How we did a survey and what we learned
* I'd like to discuss how we get work done in open source and what motivates people
* Then I'd like to introduce some maintainer types I observed
* And finally I'd like to bring sustainability into the discussion

---

# Why

* Many projects have a very small but dedicated maintainer group
* Users and maintainers have different perceptions and goals for a project
* Check the health of the project
* Inform user group about state of the project
* Indetify areas for improvement
* Attract new maintainers

???

* Many projects have a very small but dedicated maintainer group
* Users and maintainers have different perceptions and goals for a project
* Asses the state of the project from time to time and should do a **health check for themselves**
* From time to time I think projects should inform user group about state of the project
* Users & maintainers can work together to indetify areas for improvement
* By definining work that needs to be done projects can attract new maintainers

---

# Facts about me

* Apache Cordova User
* Apache Cordova contributor in my old job
* Active Committer & PMC
* No longer real user of Cordova but maintainer in my free time
* I suck at writing CSS
* This presentation is styled using CSS

???

* Give some context
* I became a user of Apache Cordova many years ago
* Cordova is a framework for **building mobile apps using web technologies**
* **Previous job** introduced to developing apps this way
* In that job we got more and more advanced users and I started contributing
* A few years later I became a committer and PMC member
* I no longer build apps but I'm helping when I can
* Fun fact CSS

---

# Looking at the village

* Every project is different
* Is the project sustainable and healthy?
* People available for fixes and security issues
* Getting releases out and votes done in time
* Size, demographics, age & maturity of project, nothing stays the same forever

???

* Projects and their communities are very diverse
* You might also ask is the project sustainable and healthy?
* Are enough maintainers available for fixes and security issues?
* Are releases getting out in time and votes done?
* The size, demographics, age and maturity of a project can change over time


---

# Running a survey

???

* At Cordova we ran a survey.
* Collected questions on GitHub
* Google Survey
* Announced & promoted it on website and social media
* Accepted answers for a month
* Closed and compiled results
* got around 200 responses
* We thing that's a good result because only a fraction of users will respond

---

# Interesting Survey results

* Good usage data on platforms
* Open questions with great feedback
* Lot's of work for open questions
* Most used platforms match our expectation
* Deprecated stuff is barely used
* My personal impression got confirmed
* Personal feel of pressing issues confirmed
* Good ideas to work on
* Documentation is the biggest issue

---

# Pick up the work

* Scratch your own itch
* Documentation is critical
* How about the other more boring or difficult tasks?

???

* Scratch your own itch works for me
* Typical for open source
* How to get better documentation when developers don't like writing docs?
* Hard to find someone for other more boring or difficult tasks
* **A lot boils down to motivation**


---

# Motivation

* **Extrinsic**
  * Paid work gets done
  * General maintenance and community building is usually unpaid

* **Intrinsic**
  * Fix things or build features for my project
  * Love for the project and/or community
  * **What about tasks that don't fall in someones motivation window?**
  * Looking for ideas

## Maintainer personas

???

* From my experience there are common types of maintainers
* Of course one person can be more than one type
* Good to know what types of people are needed to run the project
* **Names are totally made up by me**

# Warning: AI Content Incoming

## DALL-E painted the following pictures

???

* This presentation is really lacking in images because I'm even worse at drawing than writing CSS
* I didn't use these fancy AI tools before so I thought it would be interesting to see what it comes up with just giving it my descriptions of the maintainer types
* I guess these images are full of stereotypes as AI content often is
* Dont't take these images too seriously and let's focus on the personas

From my experience this is the most important type of maintainer to keep a project alive

* Does not need attention or fame
